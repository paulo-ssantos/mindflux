MindFlux is a web-based system designed to perform knowledge management through the management of company processes. This project was created as part of the Knowledge Management subject, under the guidance of Professor André Magalhães.

## Project Overview
In this project, our team developed a Full Stack application. The system facilitates the knowledge management of companies, with registration of process, providing essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and customa Advanced text editing and flowchart creation functionalities.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: NUXT.JS, (HTML, CSS, JS, PrimeVue)
- Backend: Supabase, Typescript
- Database: PostgreSQL

### Backend Development
Focusing on the backend development, it was used using Supabse ecosystem, where the following resources were used:

- PostgreSQL Database, with data table modeling from the scratch.
- Authentication and Autorization features.

The backend of the Mindflux system is the backbone that handles data processing and ensures seamless communication between the database and the frontend. It plays a crucial role in providing a robust and efficient knowledge management solution.

### Frontend Development
Focusing on the frontend development, we use the framework for Vue.Js, Nuxt.Js with PrimeVue. With this, we take advantage of several facilities, such as:

- Automatic route mapping.
- Componetization of interfaces.
- Several pre-ready structures.

The backend of the Mindflux system is the backbone that handles data processing and ensures seamless communication between the database and the frontend. It plays a crucial role in providing a robust and efficient knowledge management solution.

## Project Status
The Mindflux System is a project that is no longer active, it was developed for the subject of "Knowledge Management" and finalized at the end of it.
